Helpdesk Lab – Azure Virtual Machine Practice

The Overview
This project documents my hands-on practice building a cloud lab environment in Microsoft Azure, simulating common helpdesk and IT support tasks.  
It demonstrates my ability to create and manage virtual networks, subnets, virtual machines, and user accounts, as well as perform routine support tasks like password resets and remote access.

 Lab Components

Resource Group: `myfirstbuild` – container for all resources.
Virtual Network (VNet): `vnet-helpdesk-lab` – private network in Azure.
Subnet:** `subnet-servers` – segment within the VNet for organizing virtual machines.
Virtual Machine (VM): `myfirstbuildmachine` – Windows Server instance for practice.
Users: Created local accounts and managed remote access via RDP.
Security Controls:Added users to Remote Desktop Users group for proper permissions.


Tasks Performed

1. Created a resource group, VNet, and subnet in Azure.
2. Deployed a Windows Server 2025 Datacenter VM within the subnet.
3. Configured RDP access for remote management.
4. Created new local user accounts and added them to the Remote Desktop Users group.
5. Performed password resets and tested login as a new user.
6. Practiced cost management by understanding VM sizing within the account type Iw was using and stopping/deallocating the VM when not in use.



Skills Practiced

- Azure portal navigation and resource management
- Virtual network (VNet) and subnet creation
- Virtual machine deployment and configuration
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) usage
- User account management and password resets
- Security awareness and permissions management
- Cost-conscious cloud practices
